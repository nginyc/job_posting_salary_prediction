    "\n",
    "Please extract the following attributes and format the output *only* as a list of JSON objects with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `experience_requirements`: A single string summarizing the required or preferred years and types of experience. Identify and concatenate the relevant phrases or sentences directly from the text. Keep the summary concise but primarily use the original wording. Ensure proper spacing and sentence structure between concatenated parts for readability, making only minimal adjustments (like adding spaces) as needed. If no specific experience requirements are mentioned, use `\"\"` (an empty string).\n",
    "2.  `skill_requirements`: A single string summarizing the key technical skills and important soft skills mentioned as required or preferred. Identify and concatenate the relevant phrases or sentences directly from the text. Keep the summary concise but primarily use the original wording. Ensure proper spacing and sentence structure between concatenated parts for readability, making only minimal adjustments (like adding spaces) as needed. If no specific skills are mentioned, use `\"\"` (an empty string).\n",
    "3.  `education_requirements`: A single string summarizing the required or preferred educational qualifications. Identify and concatenate the relevant phrases or sentences directly from the text. Keep the summary concise but primarily use the original wording. Ensure proper spacing and sentence structure between concatenated parts for readability, making only minimal adjustments (like adding spaces) as needed. If no specific education requirements are mentioned, use `\"\"` (an empty string).\n",
    "4.  `certification_requirements`: A single string summarizing any specific certifications required or preferred. Identify and concatenate the relevant phrases or sentences directly from the text. Keep the summary concise but primarily use the original wording. Ensure proper spacing and sentence structure between concatenated parts for readability, making only minimal adjustments (like adding spaces) as needed. If no certifications are mentioned, use `\"\"` (an empty string).\n",
    "5.  `min_salary`: Extract the minimum salary figure **only if explicitly stated** in the text. Look for explicit ranges (e.g., \"$100k - $120k\", \"$29.81 - $30.03 an hour\", \"90,000 to 110,000 annually\") or explicit minimums (\"starts at 90,000\"). Identify the **lower numerical value** from the range or the stated minimum. Remove any currency symbols ($, €, etc.), commas, and surrounding text. Convert 'k' notation to thousands (e.g., \"100k\" becomes \"100000\"). Output this cleaned numerical value **as a string** (e.g., \"100000\", \"29.81\", \"90000\"). **Do NOT infer, predict, estimate, or calculate** this value. If no numerical minimum salary or explicit lower bound of a range is stated, this field **must** be `\"\"` (an empty string).\n",
    "6.  `max_salary`: Extract the maximum salary figure **only if explicitly stated** in the text. Look for explicit ranges (e.g., \"$100k - $120k\", \"$29.81 - $30.03 an hour\", \"90,000 to 110,000 annually\") or explicit maximums (\"up to 130,000\"). Identify the **upper numerical value** from the range or the stated maximum. Remove any currency symbols ($, €, etc.), commas, and surrounding text. Convert 'k' notation to thousands (e.g., \"120k\" becomes \"120000\"). Output this cleaned numerical value **as a string** (e.g., \"120000\", \"30.03\", \"130000\"). **Do NOT infer, predict, estimate, or calculate** this value. If no numerical maximum salary or explicit upper bound of a range is stated, this field **must** be `\"\"` (an empty string).\n",
    "7.  `salary`: Extract a single representative salary figure **only if explicitly stated** as a specific amount (e.g., \"$110,000 per year\", \"$55.50/hour\", \"100k annually\"). **Do NOT extract ranges into this field.** Identify the numerical value, remove any currency symbols ($, €, etc.), commas, and surrounding text (like 'per year', '/hour', 'annually'). Convert 'k' notation to thousands (e.g., \"110k\" becomes \"110000\"). Output this cleaned numerical value **as a string** (e.g., \"110000\", \"55.50\"). **Do NOT infer, predict, estimate, or calculate** this value. If no single numerical specific salary figure is explicitly stated, this field **must** be `\"\"` (an empty string).\n",
    "8.  `pay_period`: Extract the time period **only if explicitly stated** alongside a salary figure in the text (e.g., \"per year\", \"annually\", \"per hour\", \"hourly\", \"per month\", \"per week\", \"bi-weekly\"). The value must be one of [\"YEARLY\", \"HOURLY\", \"MONTHLY\", \"WEEKLY\", \"BIWEEKLY\"]. Map equivalent terms (e.g., \"per year\" maps to \"YEARLY\"). **Do NOT infer** the pay period based on the salary magnitude or any other factor. If no period is explicitly stated with an extracted salary figure, or if no salary is mentioned at all, use `\"\"` (an empty string).\n",
    "9.  `job_id`: Extract only the numeric ID value from the job description XML tags. The input will contain job descriptions wrapped in tags like `<job id=\\\"123456\\\">...</job>`. Extract only the ID value (e.g., \\\"123456\\\") without any XML tags or quotes. This is a required field and should not be empty.\n",
